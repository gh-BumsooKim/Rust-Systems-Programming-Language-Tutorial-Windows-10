## Introduction
Rust is Systems Programming Language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Recently, Rust has been voted the "most loved programming language" in Stack Overflow Developer Survey because of High Performance and Safety. (Exactly Since 2016.) Because Rust has an Ownership system, might feel differ from other language. However, it has been evaluated as having high potential due to its paradigm such as memory safety. So learning Rust will be a great experience, especially if you want to become a system developer. (More Info : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))
